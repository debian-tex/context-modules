longdesc The filter module provides a simple interface to run external
longdesc programs on the contents of a start-stop environment. Options
longdesc are available to run the external program only if the content
longdesc of the environment has changed, to specify how the program
longdesc output should be read back, and to choose the name of the
longdesc temporary files that are created. The module is compatible with
longdesc both MkII and MkIV.
