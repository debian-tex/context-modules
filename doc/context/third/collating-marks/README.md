## Introduction

Collating marks are small black rules placed on the spine of printed sections. On each section the mark is moved by the length of the black rule. When the book is assembled on the spine appears a stair like pattern. Continuity of this pattern insures that the book is ordered in the correct sequence of sections.

## Description

The module is used in connection with arranging pages for folding to form sections.

Depending on the arranging scheme used the module must be set up accordingly in the set of MetaPost variables.
